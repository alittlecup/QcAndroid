ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .DS_Store
* .idea/
* .idea/.name
* .idea/compiler.xml
* .idea/copyright/
* .idea/copyright/profiles_settings.xml
* .idea/crosswalk-webview-14.43.343.17-arm.iml
* .idea/libraries/
* .idea/libraries/xwalk_core_library_java.xml
* .idea/misc.xml
* .idea/modules.xml
* .idea/vcs.xml
* .idea/workspace.xml
* ant.properties
* build.xml
* crosswalk-webview-14.43.343.17-arm.iml
* settings.gradle

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => crosswalkwebview144334317arm/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* libs/armeabi-v7a/libxwalkcore.so => crosswalkwebview144334317arm/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi-v7a/libxwalkcore.so
* libs/xwalk_core_library_java.jar => crosswalkwebview144334317arm/libs/xwalk_core_library_java.jar
* res/ => crosswalkwebview144334317arm/src/main/res/
* src/ => crosswalkwebview144334317arm/src/main/java
* src/README.md => crosswalkwebview144334317arm/src/main/resources/README.md

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
